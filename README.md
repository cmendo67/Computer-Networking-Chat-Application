# Computer-Networking-Chat-Application
Name: Carlos Menodza, Ryan Dunning
Me and my partner worked on this project. 
For this porgram, it only runs in linux.
To run the program, you have to run it through the terminal. You have to go to the directory that the chat.cpp file is located at in the terminal. Once you are there you have to compile the file.
Example:g++ chat.cpp -o chat.cpp
then run the program like this = ./chat.cpp <port number>

You have to enter the port number or else you will get a message saying you need to enter a port number after ./chat.cpp <port number>

Once the program is running.  The output is display “Welcom to chat user “ and after  “user” like in a unix shell.

This program runs like a unix shell.

When you enter the command help- it will display all the functions that this program includes.
When you enter the command myip – it will display the ip address of your machine.
When you enter the command myport – it will display your port number that you entered.
When you enter the command connect- you have entering ”connect <ipaddress destination> <portnumber>
When you enter the command list- It will display the list of connections that the program has.
When you enter the command send- you have to to run the prgram by entering send<connection id destination> <message>
When you enter the command terminate- you have to enter terminate <connection id.>
When you enter the comand exit – It closes all connections and exits the program.
